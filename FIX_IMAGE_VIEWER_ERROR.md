## 🔄 Want to Use EnhancedImageViewer? (Optional)

If you really want the slightly more performant version, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Update babel.config.js

```javascript
module.exports = {
  presets: ['module:@react-native/babel-preset'],
  plugins: [
    [
      'module:react-native-dotenv',
      {
        moduleName: '@env',
        path: '.env',
        blacklist: null,
        whitelist: null,
        safe: false,
        allowUndefined: true,
      },
    ],
    'react-native-reanimated/plugin', // ← Add this line (must be last!)
  ],
};
```

**Important**: The Reanimated plugin MUST be the last item in the plugins array!

### Step 2: Clear Cache & Rebuild

```bash
# Clear Metro cache
npm start -- --reset-cache

# Or
npx react-native start --reset-cache

# Rebuild for Android
cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd ..
npx react-native run-android

# Rebuild for iOS
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
npx react-native run-ios
```

### Step 3: Update AppNavigator.js

Change this line in `AppNavigator.js`:

```javascript
// Change from:
component = {SimpleImageViewer};

// To:
component = {EnhancedImageViewer};
```

### Step 4: Restart & Test

```bash
npm start
# Then reload the app
```

## ⚡ Which One Should You Use?

### Use **SimpleImageViewer** (Current) if:

- ✅ You want it to work right now
- ✅ You don't want to rebuild the app

- ✅ You want zero configuration

### Use **EnhancedImageViewer** if:

- ⚡ You want maximum performance
- 🎯 You're willing to rebuild the app

**Honest Recommendation**: **SimpleImageViewer is perfectly fine!**

The performance difference is minimal and only noticeable on very old devices with 100+ images.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error still showing after switching?

**Solution**: Restart Metro bundler

```bash
# Stop Metro (Ctrl+C)
npm start -- --reset-cache
```

### SimpleImageViewer not working?

**Check**:

1. Is `SimpleImageViewer.js` in your components folder? ✅
2. Is `AppNavigator.js` using `SimpleImageViewer`? ✅
3. Did you restart the app?

### Want even simpler solution?

Use the old `react-native-image-viewing` library:

```bash
# It's already installed!
# Just uncomment it in ProductDetailsPage.js
```

## 📱 How SimpleImageViewer Works

### Technology:

- **React Native Animated API** (built-in, no config needed)
- **PanResponder** (built-in gesture handling)
- **No external dependencies for gestures**

### Gestures Implemented:

```javascript
// Double Tap Detection
onPanResponderGrant: Check if <300ms since last tap

// Pinch Zoom
onPanResponderMove: Calculate distance between 2 touches

// Pan
onPanResponderMove: Track translateX/Y with 1 touch

// Swipe
onPanResponderRelease: Check if moved >30% of screen
```

# ✅ Second Error Fixed!

## 🎯 Error You Saw

```
TypeError: Cannot delete property 'initialDistance' of undefined
js engine: hermes
```

## ✅ **FIXED!**

The error is now resolved! The issue was trying to delete a property from a PanResponder object.

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### The Problem:

```javascript
// ❌ Old code (caused error)
delete panResponder.current.initialDistance;
```

### The Solution:

```javascript
// ✅ New code (works perfectly)
const initialDistance = useRef(null);
// ...
initialDistance.current = null; // Reset properly
```

**What changed**: Instead of trying to attach/delete properties on the PanResponder, we now use a separate `useRef` for tracking the initial pinch distance.

```bash
# In Metro bundler, press 'r' to reload

## 💡 Technical Details

### What Was the Issue?

PanResponder instances are not designed to have properties attached to them. The code was trying to:

```javascript
// ❌ Wrong approach
panResponder.current.initialDistance = distance; // Attach property
delete panResponder.current.initialDistance; // Delete property - ERROR!
```

### How We Fixed It:

Use a proper ref to track the initial distance:

```javascript
// ✅ Correct approach
const initialDistance = useRef(null);

// Set value
initialDistance.current = distance;

// Reset value
initialDistance.current = null; // No delete needed!
```

**Step 3**: Check the file

```bash
# Make sure SimpleImageViewer.js is updated

```

### From ProductDetailsPage

When a user taps on any image in the product details:

```javascript
// In ProductDetailsPage.js
<TouchableOpacity
  activeOpacity={0.9}
  onPress={() => openImageViewer(index)} // Opens at specific image
>
  <Image source={{uri: item}} style={styles.galleryImage} />
</TouchableOpacity>
```

### The EnhancedImageViewer

Receives:

- `images`: Array of image URLs

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Technologies Used

- **react-native-reanimated**: Smooth 60 FPS animations
- **react-native-gesture-handler**: Native gesture recognition
- **Animated API**: Spring and timing animations

### Performance Optimizations

- Native driver for animations
- Shared values for state
- Gesture worklet optimization
- Image loading indicators
- Constrained pan calculations

### Gesture Hierarchy

```
TapGestureHandler (double tap)
  └─ PanGestureHandler (swipe/drag)
      └─ PinchGestureHandler (zoom)
          └─ Image
```

## 🎨 Customization

### Change Max Zoom Level

In `EnhancedImageViewer.js`:

```javascript
// Around line 60
onEnd: (_, ctx) => {
  // Change this value
  } else if (scale.value > 4) {  // Change 4 to desired max zoom
    scale.value = withSpring(4);
    baseScale.value = 4;
  }
},
```

### Change Double-Tap Zoom Level

```javascript
// Around line 130
const newScale = 2; // Change to desired zoom level (e.g., 3)
```

### Change Swipe Threshold

```javascript
// Around line 105
if (Math.abs(event.translationX) > SCREEN_WIDTH * 0.3) {  // Change 0.3
```

### Customize Colors

```javascript
// In styles
backgroundColor: '#000',  // Change to your preference
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Gestures not working

**Solution**: Make sure `react-native-gesture-handler` and `react-native-reanimated` are properly installed.

```bash
npm list react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated
```

### Issue: Images not loading

**Solution**: Check network connection and image URLs. The viewer shows a loading indicator.

### Issue: Zoom too sensitive

**Solution**: Adjust the scale limits in the pinch handler (lines 50-70).

### Issue: Can't swipe between images

**Solution**: Make sure you're not zoomed in. Swipe only works at 1x zoom.

4. **Mapping**: Natural gesture → expected result
5. **Consistency**: Behaves like iOS/Android system photo viewers

## 🔄 Migration Notes

### If You Had Issues Before

The previous setup used `react-native-image-viewing` which should work but might have configuration issues. The new `EnhancedImageViewer` is:

- ✅ Fully customizable

- ✅ Uses packages you already have installed
- ✅ Better gesture handling
- ✅ More control over behavior

### No Breaking Changes

- Navigation still uses `'ImageViewer'` route
- Same parameters: `images` and `selectedIndex`
- No changes needed in other components
